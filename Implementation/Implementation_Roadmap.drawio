Duration is flexible: 1 week if full-time, 2 weeks if part-time. Step 1 Environment Setup: Install Python 3.10+ for latest library compatibility. Install Ollama from ollama.ai for model deployment. Install ChromaDB via pip install chromadb for semantic vector search. Install Redis server and RedisGraph module for graph database (brew install redis on Mac, pip install redis redisgraph for Python client). SQLite comes with Python. Clone Web4Articles repository containing all 534 historical PDCAs, 3,477 TypeScript component files, and 238 process documents. Create project structure: mkdir scripts data config outputs eval. Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt including transformers, sentence-transformers, peft, torch, chromadb, redis, redisgraph, sqlite3, jsonschema, tqdm. Step 2 RAG System Bootstrap: Create and run initial indexing system to process all 534 historical PDCAs. Implement PDCA-aware adaptive chunking that preserves document structure by splitting on section boundaries (header, Plan, Do, Check, Act, Meta) creating approximately 2,670 semantically complete chunks. Generate 768-dimensional embeddings using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. Store chunks in ChromaDB pdca_historical collection with comprehensive 15+ metadata fields: chunk_type, chunk_index, pdca_id, agent_name, agent_role, date, timestamp, session_id, branch, sprint, cmm_level, task_type, objective, quality_score, verification_status, trained_in_adapter, training_batch, training_date. Create nodes and PRECEDES edges in Redis Graph for breadcrumb navigation enabling read-to-depth-3 context expansion. Populate SQLite pdca_timeline table with temporal and categorical metadata for fast date-range queries. Index 3,477 TypeScript component files organized by layer (layer2, layer3, layer5) and pattern (empty_constructor, scenario_state, radical_oop). Index 238 process documents including PDCA templates, CMM framework guides, compliance checklists organized by role. Index 12K tool examples from tool_core.jsonl (10K Continue tools) and tool_neg.jsonl (2K negative anti-patterns) into tool_examples collection with metadata for tool_name, tool_ecosystem, tool_version, usage_pattern, context_type. Step 3 Data Quality Validation: Test semantic search on ChromaDB with queries like find debugging approaches or show component versioning conflicts, verify relevant results returned. Test breadcrumb navigation on Redis Graph by walking depth-3 chains forward and backward from sample PDCAs, verify context expansion works. Test temporal queries on SQLite with date-range queries, agent timelines, CMM level distribution, verify sub-5ms performance. Validate metadata completeness by sampling 100 random chunks and checking all 15+ fields are populated correctly. Create test harness baseline by running all 6 test harnesses on baseline model before training to establish improvement targets for comparison. Deliverables: Complete three-tier RAG system operational with ChromaDB for semantic search, Redis Graph for breadcrumb navigation, SQLite for temporal queries. All 534 PDCAs indexed as approximately 2,670 chunks with complete metadata. All 3,477 TypeScript files and 238 process documents indexed. All 12K tool examples indexed. Test harness baseline established. This foundation enables intelligent RAG-driven sample generation in Phase 2." id="phase1">

Duration is flexible: 1 week if full-time, 2 weeks if part-time or thorough review. Step 1 Core Sample Generation (25K samples): Generate style_core 12K samples by creating and running scripts that query ChromaDB for TypeScript files filtered by layer and pattern metadata. Extract empty constructor examples showing classes with empty or minimal constructor plus init method for scenario-based initialization. Extract 5-layer architecture examples demonstrating layer2 implementation, layer3 interface, layer5 CLI structure. Extract Radical OOP examples with deep encapsulation, no public fields, scenario-based state management, immutable scenarios. Extract scenario-based state patterns with init method, toScenario serialization, proper state handling. Each sample includes input prompt describing desired pattern, expected output showing correct implementation approximately 400-800 tokens, and metadata for task_type and pattern_name. Generate domain_patterns 8K samples by creating scripts that query ChromaDB for historical PDCAs semantically, use Redis Graph to expand via breadcrumb chains for context, then extract and distill patterns. Extract debugging methodologies by querying task_type equals debugging, distill to problem-solution pairs. Extract architectural decisions by querying task_type equals architectural_decision, capture TRON format and rationale. Extract integration patterns showing system connection approaches, collaboration patterns for multi-agent work, violation fixes showing error correction. Distill each pattern to core insight approximately 400-600 tokens rather than full PDCA 1200-1800 tokens, saving 60 percent tokens while retaining essential knowledge. Generate process_framework 5K samples by creating scripts that query process_docs collection. Extract PDCA structure v3.2.4.2 template with all required sections LINKS PLAN DO CHECK ACT META. Extract TRON decision format with Trigger Response Outcome Next ordering. Extract CMM1-4 progression showing maturity levels and compliance criteria. Extract dual link format for breadcrumb navigation forward and backward links. Extract 12-step startup protocol for new components. Extract verification checklists for quality gates. Extract 50+ key behavioral lessons from trainAI process documentation. Step 2 Specialized Sample Generation (9K samples): Generate domain_representatives 3K samples by creating scripts that select top 200-300 complete PDCAs via quality scoring based on completeness, CMM compliance, dual link validity, TRON format adherence. Use SQLite temporal queries to ensure diverse time periods not all recent, stratify across Q1 2024, Q2 2024, Q3 2024, Q4 2024, Q1 2025 for temporal diversity. Ensure diverse agents covering SaveRestartAgent, BuilderAgent, TesterAgent, RefinerAgent, IntegratorAgent, NegotiatorAgent. Ensure diverse task types covering component_creation, debugging, refactoring, integration, collaboration. Generate variations showing prompt plus expected PDCA structure, PDCA section plus next section, full PDCA generation. Generate style_refactor 3K samples by creating scripts that query for CMM2 to CMM3 transformation PDCAs. Extract code evolution patterns showing before CMM2 state and after CMM3 state with improvements. Extract continuous improvement mindset, technical debt reduction approaches, pattern application journeys. Generate guardrails 2K samples teaching framework compliance. Extract Jest ban enforcement showing use Vitest instead, manual operation prevention showing automate everything, security violations showing no hardcoded secrets, framework violations showing no constructor logic. Generate tool_awareness 1K samples teaching generic tool-calling concepts. Extract JSON structure, parameter passing patterns, context awareness. Keep IDE-agnostic with no Continue or Cursor specifics since those 12K examples stay in RAG tool_examples collection for runtime injection. Step 3 Validation and QA (3K samples): Generate eval 2K samples stratified across all training categories: 400 style_core, 300 domain_patterns, 200 process_framework, 150 domain_representatives, 150 style_refactor, 100 guardrails, 50 tool_awareness. This hold-out set is NEVER trained, reserved for unbiased quality measurement. Create validation scripts that check all 37K training samples: Schema compliance ensuring all samples have required fields task_type, instruction, input, output, metadata. Token distribution validation with average 540 tokens per sample totaling approximately 20M tokens, acceptable range 19M-21M. Quality score validation ensuring high-quality content. Diversity validation: temporal stratification across quarters, agent coverage all roles, task coverage all types. Save to JSONL format: data/style_core.jsonl 12K, data/domain_patterns.jsonl 8K, data/process_framework.jsonl 5K, data/domain_representatives.jsonl 3K, data/style_refactor.jsonl 3K, data/guardrails.jsonl 2K, data/tool_awareness.jsonl 1K, data/eval.jsonl 2K. Deliverables: 37K production-ready training samples generated entirely from RAG queries ensuring consistency and traceability, 2K stratified eval set for unbiased testing, all samples quality validated with documented statistics showing token distribution, schema compliance, diversity metrics.

Duration 1+ weeks mostly compute time. Step 1 LoRA Training (8-11 hours compute): Create and configure training script using base model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from HuggingFace, full precision FP16 for maximum learning quality. Load all 37K training samples from JSONL files totaling approximately 20M tokens. Configure training: 2 epochs meaning each sample seen twice, batch size 1 with gradient accumulation 12 giving effective batch size 12 for stable gradients, learning rate 2e-4 with cosine annealing schedule gradually reducing learning rate, LoRA hyperparameters rank r equals 16 creating small trainable matrices, alpha equals 32 scaling factor, dropout equals 0.05 regularization. Apply LoRA to all attention and feedforward layers in 28 transformer layers. Use AdamW optimizer with weight decay 0.01. Implement real-time monitoring: Loss convergence expecting plateau at 0.6-1.0 range indicating good learning without overfitting, if loss stays above 1.5 investigate underfitting, if drops below 0.4 investigate overfitting. Memory usage must stay under 28GB to prevent OOM crashes on 32GB M1 Mac, reduce batch size or grad accumulation if needed. Gradient norms should remain stable, if exploding reduce learning rate. Perplexity should decrease over time. Training takes 8-11 hours on M1 Mac with MPS Metal Performance Shaders backend, 20 percent faster than previous 10-14 hours due to reduced token count from 25M to 20M. Output LoRA adapter approximately 80MB saved to outputs/web4_balanced_lora_YYYYMMDD/ containing learned Web4-specific patterns: 95 percent Web4 patterns PDCA methodology code architecture OOP principles, 3 percent generic tool awareness, 2 percent guardrails, without modifying 14GB base model. Step 2 Merge and Quantize (2 hours): Create scripts to merge 80MB LoRA adapter weights into 14GB base model creating unified model with Web4 knowledge permanently integrated. Quantize merged model from FP16 full precision to Q4_K_M 4-bit quantization using 4-bit integers for most weights while keeping higher precision for critical attention layers, optimal balance between size and quality. Verify size reduction 14GB FP16 compresses to 4GB Q4_K_M, 4x reduction enabling deployment on consumer hardware. Quality retention quantization maintains 95 percent of full precision quality validated through eval metrics. Convert to GGUF format efficient file format for LLM storage optimized for CPU and Metal GPU inference used by Ollama. Create Ollama modelfile defining configuration system prompt, temperature, context window, stop tokens. Import to Ollama: ollama create web4-agent:latest -f Modelfile. Test deployment: Load time approximately 3 seconds on M1 Mac cold start, generation speed approximately 20 tokens per second, memory footprint approximately 4GB loaded. Step 3 Comprehensive Evaluation (4 hours): Create evaluation harness running 2K hold-out eval samples NEVER trained for unbiased measurement. Test Harness 1 Pattern Compliance: Validate 100 generated PDCAs against v3.2.4.2 schema, must pass 95 out of 100 Ship Gate deployment blocked if fails. Test Harness 2 PDCA Template: Check all required sections present LINKS PLAN DO CHECK ACT META, must pass 95 out of 100 Ship Gate. Test Harness 3 TRON Format: Validate Trigger Response Outcome Next ordering in decisions, must pass 90 out of 100 Quality Gate document if fails but can deploy. Test Harness 4 Empty Constructor: Check generated classes for no-constructor-logic rule using ESLint plus AST parser, must pass 95 out of 100 Ship Gate. Test Harness 5 Tool Success: Run 100 scripted IDE tasks measuring prompt to correct tool JSON to successful execution, must pass 85 out of 100 Quality Gate. Test Harness 6 Refusal F1: Test 200-item safety set 100 should-refuse 100 should-comply, must achieve F1 at least 0.98 Ship Gate. Run 20 Canary Tests: Must-not-regress tasks comparing new model vs baseline, all 20 must pass no regression over 5 percent. Calculate Overall Score: Weighted average of all metrics must be at least 90 percent Ship Gate. Document results in outputs/eval_report_YYYYMMDD.md with pass fail for each gate, overall score, recommendations. If any Ship Gate fails halt deployment rollback investigate root cause fix retry. If all gates pass proceed to production. Step 4 Production Deployment (1 hour): Deploy web4-agent:latest GGUF model to Ollama model registry. Connect RAG system: ChromaDB pdca_historical for semantic search 534 PDCAs and 3477 components, Redis Graph breadcrumb_graph for depth-3 traversal, SQLite pdca_timeline.db for temporal queries. Configure ToolAwarePromptBuilder: Set tool_ecosystem equals continue, n_results equals 2-3 examples, metadata filters for tool_name and usage_pattern. Start Ollama server: ollama serve providing REST API for LLM queries, chat interface, embedding endpoint. Run smoke tests: Test trained knowledge query explain empty constructor should answer under 200ms no RAG. Test historical reference query how did we solve component versioning should query RAG include citations approximately 500ms. Test tool query read Button.tsx should detect tool query RAG tool_examples inject examples generate correct XML tool call approximately 2250ms. Monitor response time RAG hit rate quality.

Duration ongoing forever. Step 1 Production Monitoring (continuous): Create production monitoring dashboard tracking response time should be under 200ms for trained knowledge queries no RAG, approximately 500ms for trained plus RAG history queries, approximately 2250ms for trained plus tool queries, weighted average approximately 2100ms optimal. Track RAG hit rate validating 10-20 percent of queries need PDCA history 30 percent need tool injection 50-60 percent pure trained validating Training-First architecture. Track query type distribution: Pure Trained 50-60 percent answering from trained Web4 patterns without RAG, Trained plus Tools 20-30 percent code generation with file access tool calls, Trained plus History 10-15 percent reference past work, Trained plus Both 5-10 percent complex queries needing history and tools. Collect operational data: User feedback thumbs up down on response quality, error logs for failed queries, edge cases requiring special handling, false positive tool detections, RAG misses where relevant PDCA not retrieved. Create daily work indexing system: All new PDCAs created today automatically indexed to daily_buffer collection with metadata trained_in_adapter equals False, new code changes decisions learnings captured, typical daily yield 50-200 samples depending on project activity. Step 2 Evening Training Loop Automation (nightly 10 PM): Create evening loop orchestrator script scheduled via cron job 0 22 asterisk asterisk asterisk for 10 PM nightly execution with logging to logs/evening_loop_YYYYMMDD.log. Configure alerting: Slack webhook or email on failure, PagerDuty for critical issues. Implement loop sequence: Query daily_buffer collection for PDCAs with metadata trained_in_adapter equals False identifying new untrained content, typical yield 50-200 samples. Apply quality scoring using same metrics as initial training: completeness, CMM compliance, dual links, TRON format, quality_score 0-100. Extract patterns: new problem-solution pairs, refactoring journeys, architectural decisions, learnings. Generate incremental training samples in JSONL format following same schema as initial 37K samples. Incremental LoRA training on new samples for 1 epoch only with reduced learning rate 1e-4 to avoid catastrophic forgetting of original 37K samples trained knowledge. Training takes 2-3 hours for typical 50-sample batch. Monitor loss memory gradient norms. Run 20 canary tests: must-not-regress tasks comparing new adapter against baseline adapter from yesterday, fail if any task regresses over 5 percent. If canary passes proceed, if canary fails auto-rollback to yesterday adapter create incident PDCA alert on-call skip tonight update. Mark as trained: Update RAG metadata setting trained_in_adapter equals True training_batch equals nightly_YYYYMMDD training_date equals ISO8601 timestamp for all trained chunks. Move to historical: Move PDCAs from daily_buffer to pdca_historical collection, update Redis Graph with new PRECEDES edges for breadcrumb navigation. Clear and archive: Archive daily_buffer to logs/daily_buffer_YYYYMMDD.jsonl, clear collection, reset for tomorrow. Validate nightly improvements each morning: Test previously challenging queries should be better, validate no regressions on baseline tasks canary protection, monitor quality metrics should maintain or improve, collect user feedback should be positive. Track cumulative improvements over time: Model gets smarter from real project work daily, adapts to evolving practices organically, discovers new patterns from production usage. Step 3 Optimization and Documentation (ongoing): Create RAG parameter optimization scripts: Adjust n_results for optimal context 2-3 examples for tools 3-5 chunks for history, tune semantic similarity thresholds, optimize metadata filter combinations. Implement caching system: LRU cache for frequently accessed PDCAs reducing RAG query latency from 300ms to 50ms for cached items, cache top 100 most queried PDCAs based on access logs. Create operational runbooks: docs/runbooks/evening_loop_troubleshooting.md with common failure modes canary tests failing training OOM crashes no new data to train, docs/runbooks/rag_maintenance.md for re-indexing backup restore procedures, docs/runbooks/model_rollback.md for emergency rollback steps.

The 90/10 Framework principle states that 90 percent of effort should be in planning and data preparation Phases 1 and 2 setting up RAG system generating 37K samples ensuring quality and diversity, while only 10 percent of effort is in execution Phase 3 with training taking 8-11 hours evaluation 4 hours deployment 1 hour for total approximately 15 hours compute time. This front-loaded planning investment pays dividends in model quality because high-quality training data leads to excellent model performance reducing need for trial-and-error retraining cycles. Flexible Timeline principle emphasizes taking time needed for quality rather than rushing to arbitrary deadlines. Timeline is 3 weeks if full-time aggressive schedule, 6 weeks if part-time or careful validation preferred. Don&#39;t skip validation steps, don&#39;t rush sample generation quality, allow time for thorough testing and documentation. The saying measure twice cut once applies: invest time upfront in RAG setup and sample quality to avoid expensive retraining later. Quality Gates principle establishes binary pass fail criteria preventing broken models from reaching production. Ship Gates are hard requirements that must pass for deployment: Pattern Compliance at least 95 percent ensuring generated PDCAs follow v3.2.4.2 schema, PDCA Template at least 95 percent ensuring all required sections present, Empty Constructor at least 95 percent ensuring no-constructor-logic rule followed, Refusal F1 at least 0.98 ensuring safety and guardrails work, Overall Score at least 90 percent ensuring model meets minimum quality bar. Quality Gates are strong recommendations that should pass but won&#39;t block deployment if they fail: TRON Format at least 90 percent, Tool Success at least 85 percent. If any Ship Gate fails deployment is halted immediately, rollback to last-known-good adapter, create incident PDCA, investigate root cause, fix issues, retry training. Canary Tests are 20 must-not-regress tasks comparing new model against baseline model, all 20 must pass with no regression over 5 percent. This protects against catastrophic forgetting where nightly training accidentally breaks previously working capabilities. Auto-rollback on failure automatically reverts to yesterday adapter if canary tests fail during evening loop, no human intervention needed, create incident PDCA for investigation. Training-First Production principle defines the production architecture where trained knowledge is PRIMARY and RAG is SUPPLEMENTARY. The model uses its trained patterns FIRST covering 80-90 percent of queries with fast under 200ms latency. Query distribution in production: 50-60 percent pure trained queries answering from trained Web4 patterns methodology without RAG fast, 20-30 percent trained plus tools queries needing file access or command execution injecting 2-3 tool examples from RAG adding approximately 150ms, 10-15 percent trained plus history queries needing reference to past work retrieving 3-5 relevant PDCAs from RAG adding approximately 300ms, 5-10 percent trained plus both complex queries needing history and tools combining both RAG types. Weighted average latency: 0.55 times 200ms plus 0.25 times 2250ms plus 0.15 times 500ms plus 0.05 times 2550ms equals approximately 2100ms optimal. This validates the Training-First architecture where model primarily uses trained knowledge 50-60 percent with RAG serving supplementary role for historical context 10-20 percent and tool syntax 30 percent. The hybrid approach achieves optimal balance between speed trained inference fast and accuracy RAG provides historical facts and current tool syntax." id="principles">
